📚 NumPy Calculator – Interactive Array Operations Tutorial

Python • NumPy • Jupyter Notebook

A comprehensive interactive project demonstrating how NumPy can be used to perform mathematical, statistical, and array manipulation operations through a menu-driven calculator system.
This project helps learners understand the core functionality of NumPy using a structured, hands-on approach.

🎯 Project Overview

The NumPy Calculator acts as a simple yet powerful tool to explore array-based operations.
It allows users to perform:

Basic arithmetic on arrays

Statistical computations

Array manipulation and transformations

This interactive Python-based project reinforces key NumPy concepts while simulating real-world numerical data analysis workflows.

✨ Features
Module 1: Basic Operations

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power operations on two NumPy arrays.

Module 2: Statistical Operations

Compute mean, median, standard deviation, variance, min, max, sum, and product.

Analyze array shape, size, and data type.

Module 3: Array Manipulation

Reshape arrays

Sort and reverse arrays

Extract unique values

Access first and last elements

Filter values greater than mean

Interactive Menu

User-friendly console-based interface

Supports continuous execution until the user exits

Displays clean formatted output for better readability
